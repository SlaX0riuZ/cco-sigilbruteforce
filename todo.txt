Divine Collector's Cube Price Check

first: base price + tally cap + divine base price increase
next: mult by tally multiplier, then mult by divine price multiplier
next: add leftover tallies (negligible), then mult by COLLECTOR'S divine price multiplier
next: add divine price addition, then mult by prefix multi (with accentuation)

THEN sigils are applied
